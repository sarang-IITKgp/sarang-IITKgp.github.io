#### Research

My research delves at the interface optical physics and communication engineering. I explore fundamental properties of electromagnetic waves and its interaction with matter, to build next generation of communication technologies.  
My current research interests are:

- Electromagnetic wave interaction with complex media.
- Non-reciprocity and non-reciprocal devices.
- Reconfigurable microwave & mmWave components.
- Microwave photonics: Microwave optical links, optical control of microwave devices.
